Get the byu components from the web teams of BYU

Header has to be with the right color configuration plus the BYU 
  - put the buttons as html

Put on the footer

Components get from Pete / his team - slack channel to get access to to get help with the web community on campus

Where can I get the color? components
Specific fonts that we should use? located in the css look for the header font and the text font

  Maintainability
  Ejecting react app to readable html?  or...not.  blah but then it has to get compiled every time 

webcommunity.byu.edu/resources

Strategize on this dichotomy tree:
1. Do we want to modify this website?
  T 2, F 3
2. What would be the estimated time to complete this?
3. What would it take to reformat this to conform to a Drupal site, etc.  what functionality would we sacrifice for what maintainability standard?

Publishing
Is it a folder?  Drupal?
Point of reference: drupal

2 options
1) barebones
  + control
  - biggest con maintainability
2) drupal
  - extract html
  - blocks -> thing

send an email to pete talking about pros/cons with the action being please switch to drupal and give us the login credentials, in the meantime extract something for the homepage
musigmarho.byu.edu - do homepage with pete in the room, and also pre-research what it would take to put calendar.
